It's a tool that permits represent graphically Turing machines in the form of graphs, as well as to validate a string for the Turing machine represented in question.

## Details
jTuringMachine allows make your graphs and save a file in .jtmx formmat which is a specific xml jTuringMachine.

Being developed in Java Technology, jTuringMachine takes the benefits of this technology allowing cross-platform application is also possible to change the apparence of the application to the Operating System that you are using (Windows, Linux, Solaris).

jTuringMachine is a free software project focused on the learning of the Turing machines, most of all hope will be useful for students and teachers respectively who attend and teach subjects such as Theory of Computation, Automata, etc. You can also download the code if you want to know how make some process.

The project is currently under development but has been moving considerably as the system currently works in the graphic module.
